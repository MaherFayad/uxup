                    Client is Mit olins which was founded in December, 2013 after Milt Olin, a prominent Music Entertainment Attorney, tragically lost his life due to the thoughtlessness of an LA County Sheriff Deputy, who was distracted driving. The Milt Olin Foundation team, along with Milt’s widow Louise Olin, is committed to making our roads safe for everyone by eliminating distracted driving through education, community awareness, collaboration, and advocacy. Thus, the Let’s Freakin’ Go App (our app) was born.
